# Wekan

<!-- XXX Need to improve this introduction -->

Wekan is an open-source *kanban* board that let you organize things in cards,
and cards in lists. You can use it alone, or with your team and family thanks to
our real-time synchronisation feature. Wekan is a land of liberty and you can
implement all sort of workflows on it using tags, comments, member assignation,
and many more.

Since it is a free software, you donâ€™t have to trust us with your data and can
install Wekan on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do
that by providing one-click installation for the
[Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) platform and verified
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) images.

Wekan is released under the very permissive [MIT license](LICENSE), and made
with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).
